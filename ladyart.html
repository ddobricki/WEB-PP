            the Lady Demeter has never ceased reinventing itself. At the convergence of modernity and elegance, it encapsulates the quintessence
            of Demeter style, with its architectural lines and distinctive cannage. <hr> <br>For the Demeter Lady Art project, the House invites several artists
            each season to play the metamorphosis game, transforming this object of desire into a veritable work of art. These multi-expressive
            personalities share a common goal: to sublimate the heritage and fundamentals of this fascinating symbol, in the light of their own
            singular universe.<br><br></div>

        <div class="col-6 col-md-4 custom-text"> <br> <b>MIRCEA CANTOR </b> <br> <br> Mircea Cantor's poetic works, suspended between dream and
            reality, lucidly reflect his commitment to contemporary society. His singular vision is embodied in a polymorphous practice that 
            utilizes a variety of media, such as video, animation, sculpture, drawing, photography and performance but also collaborations with 
            artisans for the conception of unprecedented installations, with a view to broadening the field of knowledge through this savoir-faire. 
            Mircea Cantor was awarded the Marcel Duchamp Prize. His creations are presented in prestigious international collections, notably at the 
            Centre Pompidou in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. <br><br>

            Dressed by turns in black or beige leather, they are adorned with hypnotic embroidery evoking the beauty of the Garden of Eden, 
            inspired by a traditional gilet from his native country, Romania. A dazzling cameo of shimmering colors, featuring the iconic 
            cannage and its graphic lines, highlighted by a leather cord. A recurrent element in his work, the cord symbolizes connection, 
            transmission and continuity. Conveying an extreme attention to detail, the handles bear the words "Make heaven out of what you have" – 
            in French, English and Romanian – while the charms are reinvented in an elaborate golden version, borrowed from the lexicon of jewelry. 
            A delicate secret, the inside of each bag contains a hand-designed silk scarf signed by Mircea Cantor as well as a logbook annotated by 
            the artist, inviting us to an enthralling immersive journey into the genesis of this exceptional project. <br><br></div>

            ultra-colorful works fusing traditional Native American artisanship with a bold, almost psychedelic pop aesthetic. A versatile artist, 
            he combines painting, sculpture, engraving, textiles and video to create a hybrid visual vocabulary. His pieces acquire the power 
            of the spoken word, chanting contemporary slogans or song verses: modern-day narratives take on unique forms – like his iconic 
            boxing bags – and celebrate the forgotten, the marginalized. All invite a (re)reading of everyday life and society through the prism 
            of art. <br><br>

            beading, on two brand-new Lady Demeter bags. A fusion of elegance and sportswear, these objects of desire are adorned with a 
            thousand and one beads in neon hues, allied with leather, nylon and neoprene inserts. The first model refers to Native American 
            motifs, while the second – in small format – symbolizes a face, the artist’s emblem. The "D,I,O,R" charms metamorphose into giant 
            pixels, materializing the founding links between past and present.  <br><br></div>

            transformed into bewitching creations with multiple effects, saturated with color and materials. These exceptional pieces are adorned 
            with a representation of the iconic tandem – evoking the richness and beauty that punctuate their Art – while the manifesto phrase 
            "LOVE ALWAYS AND ALLWAYS", printed in 3D, embellishes the back of the bag. At the convergence of artisanship and innovation, one of 
            the models is dressed entirely in delicately embroidered beads, lending and irresistibly couture allure to the ultramodern design of 
            this object of art and desire.
